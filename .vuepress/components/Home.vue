                    Fund your project with a trustworthy crowdsale.<br>
                    Using FriendsFingers, you can easily deploy a Smart Contract that will hold contributor's
                    money until any given date or goal is reached.<br>
                    Depending on the outcome, the funds will either be released to the project owners or
                    safely returned back to the contributors.<br>
                    All of this is possible without requiring a centralized arbitrator, clearing house
                    or having to trust anyone.<br>
                    You can even use the token you create to keep track of the distribution of rewards.
