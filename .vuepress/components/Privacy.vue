                            The Owner takes appropriate security measures to prevent unauthorized access, disclosure,

                            using computers and/or IT enabled tools, following organizational procedures and modes
                            strictly related to the purposes indicated. In addition to the Owner, in some cases, the
                            Data may be accessible to certain types of persons in charge, involved with the operation of
                            this Application (administration, sales, marketing, legal, system administration) or

                        <h4>Legal basis of processing</h4>
                        <p>The Owner may process Personal Data relating to Users if one of the following applies:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Users have given their consent for one or more specific purposes. Note: Under some
                                legislations the Owner may be allowed to process Personal Data until the User objects to
                                such processing (“opt-out”), without having to rely on consent or any other of the
                                following legal bases. This, however, does not apply, whenever the processing of
                                Personal Data is subject to European data protection law;
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                provision of Data is necessary for the performance of an agreement with the User and/or
                                for any pre-contractual obligations thereof;
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the Owner is
                                subject;
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                processing is related to a task that is carried out in the public interest or in the
                                exercise of official authority vested in the Owner;
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the
                                Owner or by a third party.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            In any case, the Owner will gladly help to clarify the specific legal basis that applies to
                            the processing, and in particular whether the provision of Personal Data is a statutory or
                            contractual requirement, or a requirement necessary to enter into a contract.
                        </p>

                            parties involved in the processing are located.<br><br>
                            Depending on the User's location, data transfers may involve transferring the User's Data to

                            transferred Data, Users can check the section containing details about the processing of

                            security measures taken by the Owner to safeguard their Data.<br><br>
                            If any such transfer takes place, Users can find out more by checking the relevant sections
