                        at any time.
                    </p> <h4>Legal basis of processing</h4> <p>The Owner may process Personal Data relating to Users if one of the following applies:</p> <ul><li>
                            Users have given their consent for one or more specific purposes. Note: Under some
                            legislations the Owner may be allowed to process Personal Data until the User objects to
                            such processing (“opt-out”), without having to rely on consent or any other of the
                            following legal bases. This, however, does not apply, whenever the processing of
                            Personal Data is subject to European data protection law;
                        </li> <li>
                            provision of Data is necessary for the performance of an agreement with the User and/or
                            for any pre-contractual obligations thereof;
                        </li> <li>
                            processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the Owner is
                            subject;
                        </li> <li>
                            processing is related to a task that is carried out in the public interest or in the
                            exercise of official authority vested in the Owner;
                        </li> <li>
                            processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the
                            Owner or by a third party.
                        </li></ul> <p>
                        In any case, the Owner will gladly help to clarify the specific legal basis that applies to
                        the processing, and in particular whether the provision of Personal Data is a statutory or
                        contractual requirement, or a requirement necessary to enter into a contract.
                    </p> <h4>Place</h4> <p>
                        The Data is processed at the Owner's operating offices and in any other places where the
                        parties involved in the processing are located.<br><br>
                        Depending on the User's location, data transfers may involve transferring the User's Data to
                        a country other than their own. To find out more about the place of processing of such
                        transferred Data, Users can check the section containing details about the processing of

                        Users are also entitled to learn about the legal basis of Data transfers to a country
                        outside the European Union or to any international organization governed by public
                        international law or set up by two or more countries, such as the UN, and about the
                        security measures taken by the Owner to safeguard their Data.<br><br>
                        If any such transfer takes place, Users can find out more by checking the relevant sections

                            this document or by contacting the Owner.
                        </li></ul> <p>
                        The Owner may be allowed to retain Personal Data for a longer period whenever the User has
                        given consent to such processing, as long as such consent is not withdrawn. Furthermore, the
                        Owner may be obliged to retain Personal Data for a longer period whenever required to do so
                        for the performance of a legal obligation or upon order of an authority.<br><br>
                        Once the retention period expires, Personal Data shall be deleted. Therefore, the right to

                        situation to justify the objection.
                    </p> <p>
                        Users must know that, however, should their Personal Data be processed for direct marketing

                        justification. To learn, whether the Owner is processing Personal Data for direct marketing
                        purposes, Users may refer to the relevant sections of this document.
